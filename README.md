## ***<div align="center">Hi! I'm Derek! I'm a Data Analyst looking for a new job</div>***

If you're looking for a data analyst who loves turning raw data into meaningful insights, you're in the right place! ðŸš€ I'm passionate about data visualization, SQL, Python, and all things analytics. Currently, I'm finishing a Google Data Analytics Certificate and I'm actively looking for opportunities to grow and contribute in the field of data analysis.

I recently completed the **Google Data Analytics Certificate**, which you can check out [here](https://www.credly.com/badges/d564f34c-2a7c-438e-8583-4662a4e5e6ff/public_url). I'm always eager to learn and grow in the field of data analysis, and I'm actively looking for opportunities where I can contribute my skills.  

I enjoy working on projects that challenge me to think creatively and find data-driven solutions. Feel free to check out my repositories, connect with me, or just say hi! âœ¨ I'm always open to new opportunities and collaborations.
