## ***<div align="center">Hi! I'm Derek! I love working with data and solving problems</div>***

If you're looking for someone who enjoys turning raw data into meaningful insights, you're in the right place! ðŸš€ I'm passionate about data visualization, SQL, Python, and all things analytics.  

I recently completed the **Google Data Analytics Certificate**, which you can check out [here](https://www.credly.com/badges/d564f34c-2a7c-438e-8583-4662a4e5e6ff/public_url). I'm always eager to learn, take on new challenges, and find creative solutions using data.  

I enjoy working on projects that push me to think critically and uncover valuable insights. Feel free to check out my repositories, connect with me, or just say hi! âœ¨ I'm open to new opportunities, collaborations, and interesting projects.
